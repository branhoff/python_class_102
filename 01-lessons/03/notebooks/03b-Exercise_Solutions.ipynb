    "1. Write a class named `Bird` that has a method named `call`.  The `call` method should return the string `\"chirp\"`.  Next write a class named `Duck` that inherits from `Bird` and overrides the call method to return `\"quack\"`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Bird:\n",
    "  def call(self):\n",
    "    return \"chirp\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Duck(Bird):\n",
    "  def call(self):\n",
    "    return \"quack\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a class named `Employee` that has two private data members: `name` and `salary`.  It should have a constructor that takes two parameters and uses them to initialize its data members.  It should have get methods named `get_name` and `get_salary`.  It should also have a method named `gross_monthly_pay` that returns 1/12 of the `Employee`'s salary.  Next write a class named `SeniorEmployee` that inherits from `Employee` and overridesÂ `gross_monthly_pay` to add a $500 bonus - use `super()` to call the `Employee` version of the method and then add $500 to that.\n",

    "        return super().grossMonthlyPay() + 500\n",
    "```\n",

    "3. For this exercise, you'll use the `Rectangle` class above (you can assume that the length and width are measured in feet).  Write a class named `Carpet` that has two private data members: `size` and `cost_per_sq_foot`.  It should have a constructor that takes a `Rectangle` object and a float as parameters and uses them to initialize its data members. It should have get methods named `get_size` and `get_cost_per_sq_foot`.  It should also have a method named cost that asks the size data member for its area and uses that to calculate and return the cost of the `Carpet`.  This is an example of class composition because the `Carpet` class contains a `Rectangle` object as one of its data members.\n",

    "## Inheritance\n",
    "With inheritance, we define one class as being a subtype of another class.  This is often described as an is-a relationship.  For example, a duck is-a bird, a laptop is-a computer, a house is-a building.  If we’ve already defined a `Bird` class, then having our new `Duck` class inherit from `Bird` lets it inherit methods that have already been defined in the `Bird` class.  The syntax for having one class inherit from another is quite simple.  In the class definition, instead of\n",

    "We would say that `Square` is the subclass or \"child\" of `Rectangle`, and that `Rectangle` is the superclass or \"parent\" of `Square`.  `Square` has inherited the area and perimeter methods from `Rectangle`, so they don't need to be defined in the `Square class`.  However the constructor did need to be re-defined in `Square` because it needs to behave a little differently than the `Rectangle` constructor.  This is an example of overriding a method.  You override an inherited method to give it different behavior in the child class than it has in the parent class.  To override a method, you just define it, using the same name, in the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you need to override a method, you can sometimes still make use of the parent's version of the method.  We can do this with `super()`, which gives you a temporary object of the parent class that you can use to call its methods.  We can use `super()` to rewrite the `Square` class like so:\n",

    "You can add as many levels of inheritance as you wish.  For example at the top level you could have an `Animal` class, the `Mammal` class could inherit from the `Animal` class, the `Dog` class could inherit from the `Mammal` class, and the `Greyhound` class could inherit from the `Dog` class.  A `Husky` class could also inherit from the `Dog` class, and a `Cat` class could also inherit from the `Mammal` class.  Graphical user interfaces typically make extensive use of inheritance to create a hierarchy of windows, panes, dialog boxes, buttons, etc.  Each class in the hierarchy has certain basic functionality in common that they all inherited from their common ancestors, but each is tailored to fit its own specific niche."

    "Object composition is just when one class contains an object of another class as one of its data members. This is often described as a has-a relationship.  For example, a duck has-a beak, a laptop has-a battery, a house has-a roof.  With composition a class is using an object of some other class instead of being an object of the other class.  You've already seen examples of classes that contain other objects, such as lists or strings.\n",

Inheritance should be reserved strictly for cases where `class B` really is-a `class A`, and not cases where there's just some superficial similarity.  For example, we might want to write a `Cube` class and decide to inherit from `Square`:"

    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "**Polymorphism** (meaning \"many shapes\") is when code can operate on objects of different types in the same way, but with results specific to the actual object being operated on.  For example, we might have a function that takes an object as a parameter and invokes its `area()` method.  We could pass it either a `Rectangle` object or a `Square` object, and either way the appropriate version of the `area()` method will automatically be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different computer languages have different ways of implementing polymorphism.  In some languages, you can only get polymorphism via inheritance.  In others, you can get it via either inheritance or an interface/protocol (which isn't a Python thing).  The approach that Python uses is commonly referred to as \"duck typing\", which gets its name from the saying that \"if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Duck typing just means that if a piece of code wants to call certain methods on an object, it will work as long as those methods are defined for that object, regardless of the actual type of the object.  If `class B` inherits from `class A`, then it has the same methods, so a function can operate on objects of both classes in the same way.  However, inheritance isn't required for polymorphism in Python.  If `class A` and `class B` are two unrelated classes, but both have defined whatever methods a function wants to use with them, then the function can still operate on objects of both classes in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of polymorphism without inheritance let's say you have a `Movie` class and a `LawnMower` class, both of which have a `start()` method.  There's no relationship between those things, so there's no reason for them to be part of the same inheritance hierarchy.  You could have a function like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### things.py\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Lawnmower:\n",
    "  '''\n",
    "  Represents a machine that cuts grass\n",

    "  represents a motion picture\n",
    "  '''\n",

    "    print(\"Movie has started.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### main.py\n",
    "```python\n",

    "def start_things(thing_list):    \n",

    "## Overriding dunder (\"magic\") methods\n",
    "Python has a number of methods that any class can override to make it behave more like Python's built-in types.   The name **\"dunder\"** comes from the double underscore at either end of the method's name.  You've already been using one such method, `__init__`.  Let's look at a few other examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `__str__` and `__repr`\n",
    "The jobs of `__str__` and `__repr__` are similar.  Both are used to return a string that represents the object.  The `__repr__` method gives an unambiguous representation of all the data in the object, and is often used in debugging and development.  You would call it like this: `repr(my_object)`.  The `__str__` method gives a more informal, perhaps more easily readable representation.  You would call it like this: `str(my_object)`.  When you print an object with the `print()` method, it calls `__str__`.  If you override `__repr__`, but not `__str__`, then `__str__` will use your implementation of `__repr__`, but the reverse is not true, so if you only implement one of them, it should be `__repr__`.  Here's an example of overloading each for the Rectangle class we saw above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __repr__(self):\n",
    "    return \"Rectangle(\" + repr(self.length) + \", \" + repr(self.width) + \")\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __str__(self):\n",
    "    return \"A rectangle with a length of \" + str(self.length) + \" and a width of \" + str(self.width)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the definition of `__repr__` calls `repr()` on its data members instead of `str()`.  The reason is that since the representation provided by `__repr__` is supposed to be unambiguous, it should use the unambiguous representations for each of its constituent parts (in this example it looks the same, but that's not always the case).\n",
    "\n",
    "### `__eq__`\n",
    "Overriding `__eq__` in a class enables you to use the `==` operator with objects of that class.  Let's again use `Rectangle` class to illustrate.   Remember that checking floats for exact equality doesn't always work because of possible roundoff error.  The `isclose()` method from the `math` module instead compares whether two values are very close.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __eq__(self, other):\n",
    "    return math.isclose(self._length, other._length) and math.isclose(self._width, other._width)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we have two Rectangle objects, rect_1 and rect_2, we can compare them for equality like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if (rect_1 == rect_2)\n",
    "    # do something here\n",

It should have a constructor that takes a `Rectangle` object and a float as parameters and uses them to initialize its data members.

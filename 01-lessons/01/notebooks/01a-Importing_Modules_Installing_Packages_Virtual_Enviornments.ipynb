    "Virtual environments are the solution to a problem that you hopefully haven't encountered yet, which is how to allow different projects to use different versions of the Python interpreter, as well as different versions of various packages.  Software developers generally try to maintain backward compatibility, so that new versions of interpreters or packages don't break old code, but sometimes a change seems beneficial enough to be worth it.  The biggest example of this for the Python interpreter is the jump from Python 2 to Python 3.  There needs to be a way to use Python 3 for new projects, but still be able to run the old Python 2 projects.  The same thing goes for different versions of packages.  If a package gets updated in a way that breaks your code, you still want to be able to run your existing projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment allows a project to have its own tailored environment with its own specific versions of the interpreter and of whatever packages it needs.  You can have any number of virtual environments, and each one can run independently of the needs of other projects.  No man is an island, but a Python project can be.\n",

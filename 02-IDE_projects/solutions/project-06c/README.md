# project-06c

Write a **recursive** function named is_subsequence that takes two string parameters and returns True if the first string is a subsequence of the second string, but returns False otherwise.  We say that string A is a subsequence of string B if you can derive A by deleting zero or more letters from B without changing the order of the remaining letters.  You can assume that neither string contains upper-case letters.

You may use default arguments and/or helper functions.

Your recursive function must **not**:
* use any loops
* use any variables declared outside of the function
* use any mutable default arguments

The file must be named: **is_subsequence.py**

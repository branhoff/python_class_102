# project-06b

Write a **recursive** function named is_decreasing that takes as its parameter a list of numbers.  It should return True if the elements of the list are strictly decreasing (each element in the array is strictly less than the previous one), but return False otherwise.  You can assume the array contains at least two elements.

You may use default arguments and/or helper functions.

Your recursive function must **not**:
* use any loops
* use any variables declared outside of the function
* use any mutable default arguments

The file must be named: **is_decreasing.py**
